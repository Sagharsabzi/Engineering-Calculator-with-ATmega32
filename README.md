# Engineering-Calculator-with-ATmega32

This project is an engineering calculator built using the **ATmega32** microcontroller. It can perform basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and square roots.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Logarithm and square root calculations
- **LCD 16x2** display
- **4x4** keypad for input

## Setup and Installation
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - ATmega32, LCD display, 4x4 keypad, scientific keypad
2. **Flashing the Code**:
   - Open the code in **Atmel Studio** or **AVR-GCC** and upload it to the microcontroller.
3. **Usage**:
   - Enter numbers and operations through the keypad, and the result will display on the LCD.
